The dataset appears to be related to liver health, with various blood test results. Here’s a breakdown of each column:

age – The age of the individual in years.

gender – The biological sex of the individual (Male/Female).

tot_bilirubin – Total bilirubin level in the blood, measured in mg/dL. Elevated levels can indicate liver dysfunction or disease.

direct_bilirubin – Direct bilirubin (or conjugated bilirubin) level in the blood, measured in mg/dL. Higher levels suggest liver or bile duct issues.

tot_proteins – Total protein level in the blood, measured in g/dL. Low levels may indicate liver or kidney disease.

albumin – Albumin level in the blood, measured in g/dL. A decrease may be associated with liver disease, kidney disease, or malnutrition.

ag_ratio – The albumin-to-globulin ratio. A lower ratio may indicate liver disease, autoimmune disorders, or chronic infections.

sgpt (ALT - Alanine Aminotransferase) – An enzyme found in the liver. Elevated levels suggest liver damage.

sgot (AST - Aspartate Aminotransferase) – Another enzyme found in the liver and other tissues. High levels may indicate liver or heart disease.

alkphos (Alkaline Phosphatase - ALP) – An enzyme related to bile ducts; high levels can indicate bile duct obstruction, liver disease, or bone disorders.

is_patient – A binary classification (0 or 1), where 1 likely indicates that the person has a liver-related disease, and 0 means they do not.

Since is_patient is dependent on the other features, this makes it the target variable. Given that the dataset involves labeled data with a target variable (is_patient) having two distinct values (1 and 2), it falls under supervised learning. The goal is to predict whether an individual has liver disease based on various medical parameters such as bilirubin levels, liver enzymes, and protein levels. Since the target variable is categorical, this dataset is suitable for categorical supervised learning, making it useful for liver disease prediction, diagnosis, and risk factor analysis.
